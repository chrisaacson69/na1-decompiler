"""
build-command-page.py — generate the per-command HTML walkthrough pages from a
structured spec, embedding each command's ROM-pulled animation.

Two page types (Chris's design):
  - ATOMIC    — a command with a self-contained formula (Grow/Build/Give/Train/
                Dam/Hire/Send/Tax). Full walkthrough: driver flow + bytecode-
                validated formula + validation table + embedded animation.
  - FUNCTIONAL — a command that delegates into a big subsystem (War->combat,
                Move->unit system, Bribe->sabotage). A SIMPLE page: what it does,
                what it triggers, and a "rabbit hole" callout linking to the
                (future) deep page. We do NOT inline a formula we don't have.

The `classify` command is the RABBIT-HOLE DETECTOR: it reads driver-call-index
(every EFFECT a command's driver reaches) and warns when a command typed `atomic`
actually fans out past the econ sandbox — so we don't author a formula page for a
command that's really a subsystem entry point.

Usage:
    py -3 tools/build-command-page.py build <cmd>|all      # write commands/<cmd>.html
    py -3 tools/build-command-page.py classify <cmd>|all   # rabbit-hole detector
    py -3 tools/build-command-page.py animid <driver_hex>  # the $E80C arg = anim id
    py -3 tools/build-command-page.py list

The GIF for a command is `commands/assets/<cmd>.gif` (produce it with
`tools/run-animation.py <anim_id> --out atlas/anim` then copy). If present it is
base64-embedded so each page is a single portable file.
