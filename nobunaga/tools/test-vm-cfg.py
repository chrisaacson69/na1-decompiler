tools/test-vm-cfg.py — non-vacuousness tests for the CFG equivalence relation.

A gate that always says "equivalent" is worthless. These tests prove the relation
(vm_cfg.structured_equivalent / contract) actually REJECTS a control-flow change:
inject a misroute into a real sub's structured form and assert the gate flags it,
while the untouched form passes. Run: py -3 tools/test-vm-cfg.py
