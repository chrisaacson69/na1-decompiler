"""Decompile-all driver — the "see the whole picture" payoff (EPIC step 3b/4).

Persists `decompiled/bank_NN.c`: every bytecode subroutine in the 4 CODE banks
(0, 1, 2, 15 — banks 03-14 are data, 0 bytecode subs), decompiled to readable C.
Deterministic: fixed ROM -> identical C forever, so this is run ONCE and the .c
files are committed. Reading the engine becomes opening a file, never re-running
a tool. Regenerate only when vm-disasm.py or vm_decompile.py themselves improve.

Pipeline (all execution-validated; na1dream package, see ARCHITECTURE.md / ROADMAP):
  vm_disasm     ROM -> VM-asm listing (correct lengths, recursive-descent subs)
  vm_decompile  listing -> per-block C  (spec-agnostic: dispatch keyed on the opcode byte)
  dream         structure -> readable C  (DREAM primary; vm_reduce/V2 fallback)

Usage (run from the tools/ dir so `na1dream` resolves):
  py -3 -m na1dream.cli.decompile_all                 # canonical DREAM C + asm -> decompiled/
  py -3 -m na1dream.cli.decompile_all --basic         # the basic goto form -> bank_NN.raw.c
  py -3 -m na1dream.cli.decompile_all --banks 1       # one bank
  py -3 -m na1dream.cli.decompile_all --out-dir foo   # alternate output dir

      bank_names[bank][addr] = name  — the authoritative name for that addr IN that bank
      sectioned = {addr, ...}        — every window addr that appears in ANY [prg.bankN]

    Banks 0/1/2 share the $8000-$BFFF CPU window, and the SAME CPU address can hold a
    DIFFERENT function in each bank (different ROM bytes at the same address — e.g. $8003
    is display_fullscreen_graphic_sequence in bank 0 but prompt_message_and_redraw in
    bank 1). `nobunaga_vm.load_labels()` flattens the toml to {addr: name}, which (a)
    discards the section AND (b) keeps only one name per address — so the decompiler was
    both bank-blind and dual-bank-blind for the window (bug surfaced 2026-05-31 by the
    regen guard for the section problem; the dual-bank case surfaced 2026-06-01 by the
    bank_00 label-walk: $8003/$8DE1 stayed anon because bank 1's entries shadowed bank 0's).
    Keying names by (bank, addr) resolves both: each bank's C uses its own section's name.

    RAM/ZP (<$8000) and fixed bank-15 ($C000+) labels are bank-independent and stay global
    (applied from vm.labels), so they are intentionally not collected here. ~73 $C000+
    labels mis-filed under [prg.bank0] are >= $C000, fall outside the window, remain global.
