tools/probe-bail-audit.py — audit the region-reducer's bail guards (atom-log discipline).

The atom-3 lesson (2026-06-05): some `_NotReducible` bails in `vm_reduce` are GENUINE soundness
invariants; others were untested "the gate can't handle this" GUESSES that the gate actually CAN
handle. Because `reduce()` self-validates every output against the CFG-equivalence gate, suppressing
a guard is SAFE — a wrong guess shows up as a gate-reject / worse fold, a correct removal as a win.

This probe suppresses each AUDITABLE guard (one whose fall-through builds a CFG-validatable node —
NOT a semantic guard like `compound_pretest`, which the CFG gate can't police, nor a crash/loop-risk
guard like `cross_edge_top`) one at a time via `vm_reduce._AUDIT_SKIP`, and reports the corpus
goto delta + how many subs got WORSE. Read it as: Δ<0 with 0 worse = the guard is over-conservative
(remove or refine it); Δ>0 or subs-worse = the guard is genuine (the gate really does reject).
