"""tools/probe-cfg-reducibility.py — the census that distinguishes IRREDUCIBLE control flow
from reducible-code-rendered-with-gotos (a missing inverse-lowering "atom").

WHY THIS EXISTS
  The V2 region-reducer epic spent sessions 7a-7g building local fallbacks for what it called
  "genuinely irreducible residue." This census tests that premise directly. A CFG is FORMALLY
  REDUCIBLE iff removing its dominator back-edges (edges u->h where h dominates u) leaves a DAG
  — i.e. every retreating edge is a natural back-edge, there are no multiple-entry loops. A
  reducible graph ALWAYS has a goto-free structured form; if V2 still emits gotos on it, the
  gotos mark a MISSING ATOM (an inverse-lowering we haven't written — e.g. branch-to-return =>
  `if (!c) return;`), NOT irreducibility.

  Result (2026-06-04): all 495 subs reducible, 0 irreducible; all 59 behind-V1 subs reducible.
  So the "irreducible residue" does not exist — the engine is structured-source-shaped and a
  complete bottom-up atom table decompiles it fully. See ../decompiler-bottom-up-thesis.md.

  Re-run as atoms land: a real atom moves SEVERAL subs out of "behind"; a 1-off moves one. That
  is the convergence gate for the bottom-up build.
