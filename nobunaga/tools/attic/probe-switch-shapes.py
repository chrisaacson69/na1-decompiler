"""
tools/probe-switch-shapes.py — classify every `switch` in the 4 code banks by whether
its case bodies form a CLEAN dispatch region (Phase-3 switch-body-inlining foldability).

A switch is CLEANLY INLINABLE iff, over the bytecode CFG:
  - the case-target blocks are pairwise distinct, and
  - each case region R_i (blocks reachable from target T_i, barriered at the merge M and
    at EXIT, not crossing the switch block S or another case target) is SINGLE-ENTRY: the
    only edge into R_i from outside is S -> T_i (no other block jumps into the middle of a
    case body — i.e. no shared tails / inter-case fall-through), and
  - regions are pairwise DISJOINT, and every region's only out-of-region successors are
    M (the common merge = immediate post-dominator of S) or EXIT.

Anything else (shared case tails, a case that falls into the default, a case body that is
also a jump target from elsewhere) stays as goto-cases — exactly Phase 3's "fall through
irregularly -> leave as goto-cases" guard.
