"""dream.py -- PARALLEL control-flow structuring back-end (DREAM approach).

A pattern-INDEPENDENT structurer: instead of matching CFG shapes against a schema
catalog (vm_reduce's region reducer), it computes a REACHING CONDITION (a boolean
formula over branch predicates) for each node and refines those formulas into
if/else/switch/loops. Goto-free by construction (Bohm-Jacopini). Compiler-
independent, so it needs no NA1-compiler reference.

  Yakdan, Eschweiler, Gerhards-Padilla, Smith. "No More Gotos." NDSS 2015.

This is a FORK, parallel to vm_reduce.py -- not a replacement yet. PoC stage:
foundation (boolean layer + tagged CFG + reaching conditions) verified before
the refinement/emit is built on top.

Front-end (bytecode->CFG, per-block C, branch predicates) is INHERITED from
vm_cfg.py + vm_decompile.py + vm_reduce._parse_block. We replace only structuring.

# RUNG 2 (value-aware) — CONSUMING-CALL STACK-PHI repair now lives in the FRONT-END
# (`vm_cfg.consuming_phis` + `vm_decompile`'s post-dispatch materialisation), where the live
# data stack lets it stay sound (each arm's CAPTURED value, no re-evaluation) and it fixes
# V1/V2's canonical output too. This DREAM-only `cr`-based ternary prototype proved the
# mechanism (6/8 eligible repaired, gate-green) and is now superseded — DREAM inherits the
# front-end's phi temps (`phi_<merge> = <value>;` per arm; the merge call reads the temp).


# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# RUNG 2 — LOOP STRUCTURING.  DREAM's acyclic core (reaching conditions → `refine`) is
# loop-blind, but a natural loop is just an ACYCLIC sub-problem once its two erased boundaries
# are put back (the un-sharing lever again): the BACK edge (latch → header) and the EXIT edges
# (a loop node → a block outside the loop). We cut both, redirecting each to a synthetic SINK
# leader — the back edge to a CONTINUE sink, every exit edge to a BREAK sink — so the loop body
# becomes a DAG rooted at the header that the existing `_acyclic_seq` structures verbatim. The
# resulting AST's sink-blocks are then mapped to `('continue', h)` / `('break', X)` markers, and
# the whole body is wrapped in a `('loop', h, body)` node emitted as `while (1) { … }`. The OUTER
# graph collapses each loop to its header (successor = the single exit target), is structured
# acyclically, and the loop node is substituted back in for the header's block. The gate is
# already cycle-tolerant (`vm_cfg.contract` bypasses routers through self-loops and keeps tail
# orientation), and `_ast_cfg` derives every edge from each block's REAL successors — so the
# continue/break markers resolve to the true header / exit and the lowered CFG matches the raw
# witness exactly. Phase 1 scope: SINGLE-LEVEL, SINGLE-EXIT-TARGET, reducible loops; any other
# shape (nested, multi-exit, irreducible, switch-in-loop) returns None → passthrough unchanged.

    """REORDER-TOLERANT structured-equivalence gate (the pseudo-address idea).

    DREAM emits goto-free C that is often correct but ADDRESS-INVERTED (a shared merge
    placed below its arms), which the address-anchored `lower_struct_cfg` rejects. Here we
    RENUMBER each emitted block with a synthetic address in EMIT order (so emit order ==
    address order by construction, below `_SYNTH_BASE` so the gate's dup-handling stays
    inert), lower THAT with the existing verified gate (which is now never reordered), then
    map the resulting CFG back to the real leaders via `synth->real` and compare to the raw
    witness exactly as `structured_equivalent` does. Identity = the real address each block
    belongs to; position = the emit-order synthetic address. No change to the shared gate.

    Sufficient because DREAM carries each block's statements VERBATIM (it rearranges blocks,
    never rewrites expressions): CFG-match + every-block-once ⇒ the right values reach every
    call/return. A dropped/duplicated block shows up as a CFG mismatch here.

    ⚠ EXPERIMENTAL — FLUSH-FRAGILE FIRST CUT (2026-06-08). Detecting block boundaries by
    `bor(addr)` line-to-line breaks on flushed-call reordering: a flushed line whose address
    belongs to a neighbouring block transiently flips the mapping and corrupts the synthetic
    block split → net REGRESSION (274→240) vs the old gate. The old gate is flush-robust
    because it stays in real-address space. CONCLUSION: don't renumber-and-reuse; build the
    CFG directly from the DREAM AST (block identity is known structurally, flush irrelevant).
    Kept behind `--check2` as the concept proof (genuine reorder wins DID appear: $E3A9,
