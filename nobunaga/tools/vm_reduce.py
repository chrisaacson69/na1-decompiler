tools/vm_reduce.py — REGION REDUCER (CFG epic V2 / "No More Gotos").

The single bottom-up CFG reducer that REPLACES the template menagerie
(`vm_decompile.structure_loops` + `structure_lines` + `structure_switches`).

WHY (the reframe, 2026-06-04 — see ROADMAP "CONTROL-FLOW STRUCTURING" epic +
[[project_nobunaga_decompiler_purpose]]): the gotos are assembly leftovers from a
structured-C source the compiler flattened. The job is to RECOVER that structure.
Template-matching cannot converge — it has no *closure under composition*, so every
new combination of shapes (a short-circuit feeding an if/else feeding a tail) looks
like a brand-new shape and spawns a new template. A region reducer DOES converge:
each rule firing collapses its subgraph into ONE abstract node that the next rule
consumes identically to a basic block, so a fixed grammar of ~7 rules yields
infinite nestings. RE-as-parsing — codegen walked DOWN the grammar; we build UP.

THE GRAMMAR (~7 fixed rules, applied to a FIXPOINT, bottom-up):
    sequence · if-then · if-then-else · short-circuit(&&/||) · while · do-while · switch
Irreducible residue (a goto INTO a block / multi-entry region) -> break one edge
with an honest goto and continue. Few, because most regions are reducible.

THE VERIFIER IS ALREADY BUILT — zero new verification work. The reducer proposes a
structured line list; `vm_cfg.structured_equivalent(raw, structured, leaders)` proves
it induces the SAME control-flow graph as the raw goto witness (== the bytecode) or
REJECTS it. Same safety model as the templates; the hard, valuable half is done.
Irreducibility is detected STRUCTURALLY by the reducer (no rule fires -> it breaks an
edge itself); the gate is a pure backstop that catches rule *bugs*, NOT the control
mechanism (inverts the template era, where gate-reject drove the fallback).

REUSE THE ANALYSIS, RE-DERIVE THE EMIT. The detectors in vm_cfg are *pure* and nail
the base shapes: `bytecode_cfg` (with value-diamonds/boolean-regions pre-contracted),
`dominators`/`post_dominators`, `back_edges`/`natural_loop`, `switch_dispatches`,
`boolean_regions`/`recover_bool_formula`. The reducer's new code is a region-tree
builder over that CFG + a tree -> (addr, indent, text) pretty-printer whose line
format matches what `structured_equivalent` consumes (so the gate reads it unchanged).

BUILD LADDER (each rung lands gate-green + measured on tools/v2-corpus.py):
    0. [DONE] harness + passthrough — reduce() returns lines unchanged; corpus wired.
    1. [DONE] block model + trivial emit — partition lines into blocks; emit seq-of-blocks
       with gotos (reproduce the raw form FROM the tree) -> proves block<->line round-trip.
    2. [DONE] sequence + if-then + if-then-else (acyclic diamonds via dom/post-dom).
    4. [DONE] while / do-while / while(1) (natural loops via back_edges / natural_loop) +
       early-return INLINING (bare-return targets become `if(C) return X;`, not a shared
       merge). 171 subs fold / 0 gate-reject. break/continue/return are loop-terminal arms;
       in-body merges use a body-LOCAL post-dom; rotated for-loops lift only the test expr.
       Conservative bails (all detected STRUCTURALLY, never gate-reject): nested loops (4d),
       compound multi-exit-test loops (need rung 3), a loop whose exit is non-adjacent or a
       pure-routing block (tail-of-if-arm), an empty then-arm with a goto-side body.
    3. short-circuit (&&/||) — DROPPED as a rung: the gate compares per-conditional-block
       orientation and contract() never removes a 2-succ block, so a merged `if(a&&b) goto`
       loses a node and is REJECTED; V1 itself emits NESTED ifs, not `&&`. No short_circuit
       bail exists in --bails. (Those cases surface as compound_pretest / multi_exit_loop.)
    cross_edge fold (DONE 2026-06-04, part of the acyclic walk, not a numbered rung): a forward
       branch to a SHARED continuation where the fall arm also reaches it but post-dom is EXIT
       (an early return on one path). `_reaches(fall, goto, n)` detects it -> use the goto-target
       as the merge so the tail is structured ONCE (the early returns become terminal guards).
       Inlined return blocks count for merge-ADJACENCY (added to `used`) but are EXCLUDED from
       the arm-ORDER disjointness check (a shared tail return floats). $9850/$A553 -> 0 gotos,
       beating V1 (which left honest gotos). behind 130->127, gotos 1541->1498, 0 gate-rejects.
    5. [DONE 2026-06-04] switch — block-level port of structure_switches as a composable region
       node (_structure_switch): keep the `switch(E){` opener, drop the `case N: goto` dispatch
       + closer, inline each case-target block's RAW lines (gotos verbatim — no break-conversion
       / no intra-case folding yet) in address order with `case N:`/`default:` labels, close
       after the last enclosed block. Folds the switch AND its enclosing loop/if (the closure
       payoff — e.g. $8D5D switch-in-while, $9BB4 fall-through ladder, both 0 gotos). +12 subs
       (171->183), V2 gotos 1624->1541, behind 142->130, 0 gate-rejects. An UN-foldable switch
       (not single-entry) still bails the sub (reason 'switch_unfoldable', 9 subs). The bigger
       switch potential (e.g. $A2D2) is gated behind a co-occurring cross_edge bail (whole-sub
       fallback hides the fold) — see the bail histogram. Follow-ups: break-conversion to the
       merge, and intra-case structuring (recurse _structure inside a case body) to match V1
       on switch subs whose cases carry ifs.
    4d. nested loops — drop the `any header inside loop -> bail` guard once 3/5 reduce noise.
    6. irreducible fallback — break one retreating/cross edge, honest goto, continue.
    7. cutover — V2 folds >= templates across all 495, every gate green -> flip default
       on, regen decompiled/*.c, DELETE the template structure_* functions.

reduce(lines, instructions) -> structured (addr, indent, text) line list.
    `lines` = the raw goto-form leaves the expression layer already emits
    (vm_decompile State.lines). `instructions` = the decoded bytecode for this sub.

RUNG 0: passthrough. Returns `lines` unchanged (== the raw goto witness, which the
gate accepts trivially since lower(raw) == bytecode by construction). Every sub
therefore reports as honest-goto / zero-fold; the templates fold more. That gap is
exactly what rungs 1-6 close. The harness, the gate wiring, and the corpus oracle
are proven FIRST, before any rule can introduce a bug.

# FROM a block-structured tree — proving the block<->line round-trip is faithful

# flushed-call reordering (a discarded side-effecting CALL is appended at its later
# FLUSH point but tagged with its earlier call-site addr; vm_decompile.State.flush_
# pending) — partitioning by block_of(addr) would move such a line earlier, changing
# WHERE the side effect lands. So a leaf preserves its lines in RAW-LIST ORDER and the
# emit is checked against raw (the corpus "honest-goto" metric == structured-equals-raw):

# === Rungs 2 + 4: sequence / if-then / if-then-else / while / do-while / while(1) =
# The single recursive structurer. `_structure` walks a single-entry region into a tree of
# Seq / IfThen / IfThenElse, using the post-dominator as each 2-way branch's merge point.
# Branch polarity mirrors the decompiler exactly: a header's raw line is `if (RAWC) goto L_T`
# (goto = TRUE arm, fall-through = the body), so the structured then-body is the FALL-THROUGH
# arm with condition `_neg(RAWC)` — the same Pattern-A/B inversion, and the print loop's
# simplify_expression cleans `!((a<b))` -> `(a>=b)`.
#
# RUNG 4 — loops compose into the SAME recursion. A natural loop (back edge u->h, h dom u)
# collapses to ONE AST node (`_structure_loop`), consumed by the surrounding walk exactly
# like a basic block — so acyclic if/then/else (rung 2) nests inside loop bodies AND wraps
# around loops for free. Form is read from the CFG (reuse the analysis):
#   * pre-test  while(C){body}      header h is the 2-way test: one succ in loop, one = exit
#   * post-test do{body}while(C)    a single latch's 2-way test gates the back edge
#   * endless   while(1){body}      no governing 2-way test; control leaves via break/return
# A pre-test header that ALSO carries statements before its test renders faithfully as
# while(1){ stmts; if(!C) break; body } (no statement reorder — the honest form). Inside a
# loop body an edge to the header is `continue`, an edge to the exit is `break`; the if/then
# builder treats those as terminal arms. In-body merges use a body-LOCAL post-dominator (the
# global pdom is wrong — a breaking arm skips the merge), computed over the loop nodes with
# the header/exit/outside edges dropped so non-breaking paths' reconvergence is what shows.
#
# CONSERVATIVE by design: any shape a rung doesn't cleanly own (a block reached twice = cross
# edge, a forward goto skipping the merge, a switch, a multi-exit loop, nested loops [4d],
# a body that would force a statement reorder) raises NotReducible and the whole sub falls
# back to the rung-1 flat emit. The CFG-equivalence gate (structured_equivalent, applied in
# vm_decompile.decompile) is the backstop: a tree that builds but mis-routes is rejected
# there and the sub reverts to honest goto — never corrupted output.

    address-based gate laundered this — it read the fall as the ADDRESS-next leader, which happened
    to match the CFG — but the emitted C READS WRONG (control visibly falls into the wrong block,
    e.g. $ADF6's `*(fp-45)=1;` falling into the `ppu_blit` of $AE2A instead of $AE78). The
    emit-order gate now rejects it. Rather than discard the whole (otherwise-correct) fold, repair
    the seam: emit an explicit `goto L_<succ>` after the offending block so the C reads correctly
    and the surrounding structure is kept.

    Invoked ONLY after a fold fails `structured_equivalent`; the caller re-labels + re-validates, so
    an incomplete repair just falls through to the old fallback. Conservative by construction — it
    touches ONLY a plain block whose EMIT-order successor (lower_struct_cfg, the gate's own view)
    differs from its single CFG successor, so a clean fold (or a CORRECT reorder like atom-5's dup
    arm, whose emit successor DOES match) is never given a spurious goto. `<succ>` is the CFG

    """CFG-neutral cleanup of the emitted lines — the caller RE-VALIDATES the result against
    the equivalence gate, so this only ever PROPOSES; an unsound proposal is rejected wholesale.

    (1) goto-to-fall-through: a standalone `goto L_X;` whose IMMEDIATELY-following emitted line
        is `L_X:` is redundant — physical fall-through already reaches X (the region reducer's
        honest-goto cuts / flat-span joins routinely emit `goto L_next; L_next:` at a boundary).
        Drop the goto. Emit-order adjacency (not address order) is the trigger, because the
        structured C is read in emit order; the gate's address-based re-check is the backstop.
        The matcher tolerates a trailing `// $addr` comment: a REAL bytecode jump carried verbatim
        from a block node (e.g. a loop-entry jump-to-condition `goto L_h; // $a` whose header `L_h`
        is the very next line, or a routing stub) keeps its provenance comment, so an anchored
        `;$` matcher would clip only the synthetic (comment-less) cuts and leave the real ones.

        Applied INCREMENTALLY when `validate(seq)->bool` is supplied: emit-order adjacency can
        disagree with the gate's re-lowering at a flat-span boundary where a block's emit-NEXT
        label is NOT its address-next leader (a REORDERED routing stub) — there the drop is
        unsound. A batch drop + one wholesale re-check reverts the WHOLE batch when any single
        clip is unsound, losing the sound ones too (e.g. a loop-entry `goto L_h; L_h:` the gate
        accepts because it understands the `while`, dropped alongside a bad stub in the same sub).
        So each candidate is validated on its own and kept only if it still passes; the unsound
        ones stay as honest gotos. Without a validator (tests), every candidate is dropped and the
        caller re-checks the batch.
    (2) then drop any `L_X:` label no surviving goto still targets (cosmetic; the gate ignores
        labels, so this is always safe)."""
