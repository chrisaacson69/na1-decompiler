tools/vm_cfg.py — Control-flow-graph extractor + C-line-list lowering.

CFG epic, Phase 0 (the honesty gate that licenses every structuring fold).

Two CFGs over ONE key space. The key space is BYTECODE ADDRESSES, because the
decompiler renders every branch target as a label `L_XXXX:` whose XXXX *is* the
bytecode target address (vm_decompile.decompile), and every `goto L_XXXX` /
`case N: goto L_XXXX` references that same address. So the C control flow and the
bytecode control flow live in the same coordinate system — no name-matching, no
synthetic labels, no fuzzy alignment.

  bytecode_cfg(instructions)      -> (cfg, leaders)
      The GROUND TRUTH basic-block graph, built straight from the decoded
      bytecode. cfg = {leader_addr: frozenset(succ)}; succ entries are leader
      addrs or the EXIT sentinel. leaders = sorted block-start addresses.

  lower_c_to_cfg(lines, leaders)  -> cfg
      Lowers a (addr, indent, text) C line list — the RAW goto witness OR the
      STRUCTURED if/while/switch form — to the SAME block graph, by interpreting
      its control flow against the shared `leaders` partition.

The equivalence gate (tools/vm-cfg-gate.py) asserts lower_c_to_cfg(...) == cfg for
every sub: a structuring transform is honest iff it preserves the CFG. Where a
transform can't be proven CFG-preserving, the decompiler keeps an honest `goto`
(which lowers trivially), so fidelity rises monotonically and is never wrong.

Granularity note — why this is robust to expression folding: most VM instructions
(loads, immediates, register ops) emit NO C line; they fold into the next
committing statement's expression. So C statement addresses are a SUBSET of
bytecode instruction addresses. We never compare per-instruction; we collapse both
sides to the basic-block partition via block_of(addr) (= largest leader <= addr).
A basic block that emits NO statement at all (a branch target whose every
instruction folds, then falls through) has exactly one honest C reading —
fall through to the next block — which is reconstructed from `leaders` alone (a
folded block cannot branch, because a branch always emits a statement).

# address that encodes which real block it copies: synth = _SYNTH_BASE + (original << 8) + idx. The
# struct lowering self-augments its leader set with synth addrs (each copy is its own block); the

    runs statements; the skip bypasses), so the inverse is a compound `if`, not a ternary.

    This is the forward shape `if(a||b){…}` lowers to (lowering-atlas `b_or`): the body block
    gets a SECOND entry edge from the chain, which a plain region tree reads as a cross-edge
    and bails — leaving the goto-into-block residue (`$9A5D`). The fix is to recover the
    compound condition (reusing `recover_bool_formula`, with {body, skip} as its two terminals)
    and contract the chain to a single `entry → {body, skip}` branch in `bytecode_cfg`, exactly
    as boolean_regions/value_diamonds are contracted, so the gate stays consistent.

    Returns region dicts {entry, body, skip, cond, cinfo, value_blocks, cond_branch_addrs} for
    the decoder + bytecode_cfg. Same soundness guards as boolean_regions: a single chain entry,
    every chain branch stays in {chain, body, skip}, and FORWARD layout (entry = min, the two
    exits past the chain) so the fold is address-monotonic. Mutually exclusive with the value /
    boolean regions (a chain whose body is a value-arm is theirs)."""

def consuming_phis(instructions):
    """Find consuming-call STACK-PHI merges, and name the temp each arm's push materialises into.

    The decoder is a single LINEAR address-order sweep over ONE shared data stack with no phi
    reconciliation at control-flow joins. When a value pushed in one block is consumed by a CALL
    in a merge block reached from several predecessors that each push a DIFFERENT value (two arms
    each `push msg; …`, a shared `redraw_window(msg)` at the join), the call pops only the
    fall-through pred's push and the JUMPing preds' pushes LEAK and are silently DROPPED
    (confirmed: `msg_storehouse_full` etc. never appear in any output). A structural gate can't
    see it (two structurings share a CFG yet differ on the value at the merge).

    FIX (phi destruction via a temp): materialise each arm's push into a per-merge TEMP, so the
    merge's call pops the temp. All arms write the SAME name, so the linear leak is harmless, and
    each arm's assignment carries its own value under its own control — sound, no re-evaluation
    (unlike a reaching-condition ternary, which would re-run a call-valued branch predicate).

    Returns `{materialise_addr: (merge, arity)}`. At each predecessor's EXIT to the merge (its
    unconditional jump, or — for the fall-through pred — the merge's call address), the decoder
    stores the top `arity` stack entries (the call's args, fully built — works for COMPUTED args,
    not just constant/load pushes) into per-merge temps `phi_<merge>_<k>` and leaves the temp
    names on the stack, so the merge's call pops the temps. All preds write the SAME names, so the
    linear leak is harmless and each arg is carried under its own control — sound, no re-eval.

    CONSERVATIVE GUARDS (only a genuine multi-path arg-merge is touched): the merge's FIRST op is a
    consuming `host_call`; ≥2 predecessors whose blocks are NOT all identical (else same args, no
    phi); and every pred leaves to the merge by an unconditional jump or fall-through (a pred
    ending in a conditional branch is skipped). Mutually exclusive with value/boolean/short-circuit

# unordered set, so a fold that SWAPS the then/else bodies (or inverts the guard
# without compensating) preserves the edge SET and slips through. The fix: record,
# per 2-way conditional block, an ORIENTED (taken, fall) pair — taken = where control
# goes when the condition is TRUE — with all negation folded out so semantically equal
# guards compare equal. A branch condition is atomic here (the VM tests one regA value
# per branch), so it is either a bare value or a single `LHS op RHS` comparison; the
# only condition rewrites structuring performs are outer `!(...)` toggling and the
# comparison-operator flips in invert_condition (`<`<->`>=`, `>`<->`<=`, `==`<->`!=`).
# _canon_cond peels both into a parity bit, so raw and structured agree iff the routing
# is the same boolean function — and disagree exactly on a real swap.

    bypass the sink (a →EXIT block routes nowhere — bypassing it preserves every arm's orientation
    toward EXIT). Restricted to ≥2-predecessor sinks by the caller: a 1-pred terminal arm (`return
    A` vs `return B`) must NOT be bypassed — collapsing those to EXIT would hide a then/else swap,
    the unsoundness the 114-suite catches. The copies==in-edges guard (vm_reduce) covers the
    content the routing-only bypass is blind to.

    If `orient` (a {cond_block: (taken, fall)} map of true/false edge labels) is given, it
    is rewired IN LOCKSTEP with the edges — each removed B->t bypass replaces B with t in
    every label too. Conditional blocks have 2 successors so are never themselves removed,
    so their labels survive and end up pointing at exactly the contracted graph's nodes.
    Doing this through contract() (not a separate resolver) is what keeps the orientation
    consistent with the contracted CFG on loop tails / mid-contraction self-loops."""
