# Chapter 11 — The Strategic Engine, Complete: All 21 Lord Commands

> Chapters 9 and 10 traced Grow and diffed its family. This chapter walks the remaining thirteen menu commands and assembles the whole picture: every action a player can take on their turn, what it costs, what it touches, and what it tells us about the game's strategic design. With the flow-following disassembler and the in-game-text resolver from chapter 9, each command's *driver* gives up its structure on one pass — the strings it shows are, quite literally, the game narrating its own mechanics. By the end the **strategic engine is mapped end to end**: 21 commands, five functional groups, one shared UI substrate.

**Links:** [Chapter 9 — Command System & Grow](./09-command-system-and-grow.md) · [Chapter 10 — Command Families](./10-command-families.md) · [Chapter 7 — SRAM Save Layer](./07-sram-save-layer.md) · [Nobunaga README](./README.md)

## Method: the strings narrate the mechanics

Once `op_8E push_imm_word` operands resolve to text (chapter 9), a command driver reads almost like a screenplay. `"Tax is %d\nEnter new tax"` followed by `"The peasants are protesting!"` / `"The peasants are delighted!"` *is* the Tax mechanic — set a rate, the peasantry reacts. So this chapter characterizes each command from its driver: the prompts it shows, the preconditions that gate it, the cost it charges, and the helper subroutines it calls. This is **structural characterization, not formula tracing** — the per-command effect handlers (the exact numbers) are a later pass — but it is enough to lay out the complete action space.

## The thirteen remaining commands

### Military

**Move** (`driver_move $96D1`) — relocate troops between your own provinces. Prompts: *"Move where?"* (province select), *"How many men"* (`number_input`), *"Will you lead them personally"*. Success: *"They have arrived safely"*. Gated by `effect_war_combat_prep_b` (a *"you have no soldiers"* check — the source must have men) and by destination capacity — the move amount is clamped to `min(src.men, dest.capacity − dest.men)`, else *"That fief can't hold more men"*. The effect (`effect_move $8CA5`) shifts the men **and blends the three military quality stats — morale/skill/arms** — as a men-weighted average of garrison-and-incoming (`scaled_force_transfer`, the same dilution as Hire), capped at the `header` ceiling; an emptied source has its military stats cleared.

> **The "lead them personally" choice MOVES THE CAPITAL** (`$9782`) — confirmed against the grounded C (2026-06-12). When the source fief *is* the daimyo's seat (and the lord isn't *"too weak for battle"*), answering yes does `fief_is_daimyo_capital[src]=0; fief_is_daimyo_capital[dest]=1` — the lord physically relocates his capital to the destination. This is not merely a "combat modifier": `fief_is_daimyo_capital` (`$6DA2`, a per-fief 0/1 flag, census-confirmed one-per-living-daimyo) is the **seat** that the assassination gate (`$A349`, mission 4) checks — *"The daimyo is out."* fires on any non-capital target. So the assassination target is a **mobile seat**: a player can relocate it (a lead-personally Move out of the capital) to dodge, and conquest reassigns it. The flag also grants a **+1 defensive multiplier** in battle (`ai_sum_battle_strength`: `(capital+2)·men`), so relocating the seat fortifies the destination. (Distinct from `province_ai_state` `$6CF7`, the Grant governance byte — `0=Home, 1=Industrial, 2=Military, 3=Balanced, 4=Farming, 5=Direct, 0xFF=unowned`; Move sets the destination to **5=Direct**, the player-run state.)

**War** (`$9855`) — launch an attack. Heavy pre-roll setup (`$9368`/`$9351`/`$9323`/`$933A`/`$9814` — combat-prep subroutines), then *"Attack where?"*, blocked by *"They are your allies!"*. Prompts: *"How many men"*, *"How much rice will they take"* (supplies — the doughnut-fief attrition mechanic lives downstream of this), *"Will you lead them personally"*. War is the **front end to combat**; the battle resolution itself is elsewhere (a later chapter).

**Hire** (`driver_hire $A5F4`) — recruit, gated by `effect_war_combat_prep_c` (a *"you have no gold"* check — recruiting costs gold). *"Recruit which"* → *"(Men/Ninja)?"* (`prompt_ab_window`) routes to **two different callees**: the *Men* branch is `effect_hire_men $A553` (the recruiting proper); the *Ninja* branch is `effect_ninja_sabotage $A2D2` — i.e. Hire▸Ninja is the front door to the whole sabotage/assassination system (the ninja deep-dive covers it).

**Train** (`$A637`) and **Assign** (`effect_assign $AC11`, driver `$AD67`) — decoded in chapter 10. Train raises skill against a header-derived cap; **Assign is the arms-allocation editor** (distribute a fief's weapon stores across the three arms types).

### Province development

**Dam, Grow, Build** — the prompt-and-apply template from chapter 10. Spend gold, get a √-curve gain in one province field (Dam→output+debt, Grow→output, Build→town), with a silent percentage drain from other fields and a `header`-gated development ceiling.

### Diplomacy

**Pact** (`driver_pact $9C4F` → price `prompt_diplomacy_pact $E3A4`) — buy peace from a rival. **Not free**: vs an AI house the price = `pct_op(gold,50) + pct_op(gold, rng(0..49)) + 20` ≈ **50–99% of your own treasury + 20**, and the AI only *offers* a pact at `1/skill` odds (refusing the militarily-weak 2/3 of the time, `fief_owner_weakness`). The gold **transfers to the target daimyo** — peace is literally bought. On success `set_pact_relation $DA4F` writes **70** into the **relation matrix** at `$6193` (a 54-stride fief×fief table, `relations_matrix_cell_addr $8C35`). Each attempt costs the player daimyo **−1 Drive**, **−2** if you decline the named price or are refused. The `$879F/$804C` helpers it shares with War/Bribe/View/Ninja are *generic province-target-select* primitives, **not** a dedicated "diplomacy subsystem."

**Bribe** (`driver_bribe $AAAE` → `effect_bribe $8D4D`) — **gold-for-spy peasant defection**, not a develop-√ command. `sqrt(gold)` peasants defect from the target's `output` into your fief's `wealth`. Gated by a **Charisma contest** (`bribe_success_check $8D02`): success iff `your(loyalty+Charisma) > target(loyalty+Charisma) + rng(10)·skill` *and* a coin flip — *"%d peasants have defected"* on success.

**Marry** (`driver_marry $9DC9` → dowry `marriage_pact_handler $E314`) — alliance by marriage, the strongest tie. Available only from your capital (`fief_is_daimyo_capital[src]`). Select a fief; the dowry (vs an AI house) = `pct_op(gold, rng(50..79)) + 200` ≈ **half-to-three-quarters of your treasury + 200**, gated on your gold > 200, offered only at `1/skill` odds. *"Lord %s, %s wants %d gold. Pay"* → the gold transfers to the target and `set_marriage_relation $DA7D` writes **90** into the `$6193` matrix (vs Pact's 70). **Refusal is costly**: your daimyo permanently loses **−1 Drive, −1 Luck, −1 Charisma** (`$9EE8`/`$9EEE`/`$9EF4`). Each attempt also costs **−1 Drive** up front. (Flavor: a rolled bride-portrait, *"Don't you long to hear the pitter-patter…"*.)

### Resource & economy

**Tax** (`$999F`) — set the tax rate. *"Tax is %d\nEnter new tax"* (`$D5E9`), and the peasantry reacts immediately: *"The peasants are protesting!"* or *"The peasants are delighted!"* — the loyalty consequence of taxation, surfaced right in the command. `$82D6` (called twice) applies the result.

**Send** (`$9A62`) — transfer resources between your own provinces. *"Send where?"*, then *"Rice"* (`$D5E9`) and *"Gold"* (`$D5E9`), each capped (*"We're at our limit"*), then *"Is this OK"* → *"The supplies have arrived safely"*. The internal-logistics command — and the reason the turn-order randomization (`$6F0B`) bites: you may want to Send before you attack, but the receiving fief might act first.

**Trade** (`driver_trade $A1B6`) — a **global commodity & credit market** behind one menu, the richest non-combat command. Requires a merchant present (`effect_trade $8A15`): always at the two commercial capitals (**fiefs 13/14**), elsewhere only when a per-turn flag is set (`ai_turn_flags & 1`, prob `(55−5·skill)%`), else *"No merchant in the area."* Six services (`jumptab_b9dc`): **Loan** (borrow against `town`; debt ceiling = town; `loan_rate` is the baked-in interest), **Repay** (1:1), **Sell rice** (→gold, price falls per sale), **Buy rice** (→rice, price rises), **Buy arms** (gold→weapons, gain diluted by force size), **Bye**. Prices come from the period-rolled rate table `$6E0B` (re-rolled each season by `roll_period_market_rates $924A`, drifting ±1 per transaction). All caps are `ratio_times10_capped`; all prices `math32_muladddiv` (rate stored ×10). **Impacts:** loans are the only way to spend past your treasury (leverage); rice↔gold trading couples the harvest economy to combat supply; and two entries of the *same* `$6E0B` table price **Hire and Ninja** — so the merchant reaches the assassination economy.

**Give** (`$AA1F`) — chapter 10's immediate-action group; the loyalty/morale charity command, touches the most province fields.

### Information & administration

**View** (`driver_view $A6C7`) — inspect a fief. Free for your own; **spying on an enemy costs 10 gold** per look (`selected.gold −= 10`; *"You have no gold!"* if under 10). Spy success is a **Luck+IQ contest** (`effect_view_d = rng(Luck) + IQ` for each daimyo): beat the target and a `1/skill` roll for a clean look, else a 2/3 fallback succeeds and the remaining third gets *"Our spy was caught."* A *"(99-view vassals)"* sub-option and a strategic-map sub-screen (same renderer as Map). View is both the information command and the **espionage** command — and one of two places IQ matters (the other being assassination resolution).

**Map** (`$AF3D`) — render the strategic map. 18 instructions, no prompt, no cost — pure display (`$E5F2`/`$AF10`).

**Rest** (`driver_rest $ADB3`) — **capital-gated** (must be home, else *"…not your home fief"*). *"Seasons"* (`number_input` 1–10) → `rest_turns_remaining[owner]` → *"It will do you good"*. The lord sits out that many turns to recover; the driver only *sets the counter* — the actual recuperation (health) is applied downstream in the per-turn tick. Cost = pure tempo (multiple action-slots).

**Grant** (`driver_grant $AF66`) — **capital-gated**; delegate a fief to an AI governance policy. *"What are your orders?"* → pick a state, written to `province_ai_state[fief]` (*"Lord, you are truly wise!"*). The driver is trivial; the meaning is in the **turn engine** (`ai_per_fief_command_driver $B89B`), which switches on the policy each turn to choose that fief's auto-action: **0 Home** = general AI economy (the default — every conquered/AI fief; *not* manual); **1 Industrial** = develop town; **2 Military** = *launch a war first*, then recruit/arm/train; **3 Balanced** = general econ dispatch; **4 Farming** = Dam + Grow; **5 Direct** = *you run it by hand* (your capital starts here). Per the SRAM census the AI itself only ever uses 0 (Home) — and **the player can never have a Home fief**: conquest inherits the *attacker's* state (`ai_state(conquered) = ai_state(attacker) ? 5 : 0`), and the player always attacks from a Direct(5)/granted fief, so **every conquest comes out Direct (5)** — you micro it or Grant it to 1–4 (states 1–4 are the player's only focus lever). The deeper asymmetry: an AI/Home fief runs its **whole cascade every turn** *plus* AI-only subsidies (a 10% stat boost, 25% arms bump, the spring boon), while the player gets **one command per fief** with no subsidies and the spring decay. Grant (Farming a breadbasket, Military an autonomous aggressor) buys back the multi-action *throughput* — but never the Home subsidies (ch.12). Delegated fiefs even auto-set their tax (≈35–64%).

**Other** (`driver_other $B23E`) — the settings/save menu (7 items via `jumptab_b9e8`). The five settings and the state they write: **Sound** (`audio_wait_gate`), **Animation** (bit 2 of `ai_turn_flags` — gates every command animation), **Wait** (text speed, `delay_loop_count = 2·n²`), **Save** (`sram_save_pending_flag`, saves at season end), **Battle** (`ui_confirm_flag_6e7d` — whether AI-vs-AI battles are shown). *End* (index 5) is the only option that ends the turn.

**Pass** (`$B2A6`) — five instructions. Show one message, end the turn.

## Reviewing the mechanics

A few things the full picture makes clear:

**Gold is the master resource.** Of the 21 commands, the ones that *cost* anything cost **gold** — Dam, Grow, Build, Bribe, Pact, Marry, Hire (the *"you have no gold"* gate), Assign (a flat 30), and the spying mode of View (10 a look). (Pact and Marry are the cruellest: their price is sized to a *fraction of your current treasury* — so a full war-chest makes peace proportionally expensive — and the gold is handed straight to the rival.) There is no separate "action point" economy; your turn is bounded by your treasury (and by the per-province `header` development ceiling) — the **one way past the treasury bound is a Trade loan**, borrowed against your town value at interest. Tax is the only command that *generates* gold, and it does so against a loyalty cost — the central economic tension of the game is the **tax↔loyalty tradeoff**, and it's surfaced literally ("protesting" / "delighted").

**Development is deliberately lossy.** Dam/Grow/Build don't just add — they add on a √ curve *and* silently subtract a percentage from other fields (chapter 10). Combined with the `header`-gated ceiling, province development is a game of **managed decline**, not free growth. A player optimizing one stat is always paying in another.

**Three of the 21 are pure information** (View, Map) **or pure pacing** (Rest, Pass) — the engine budgets real screen time for *looking* and *waiting*, not just acting. View doubles as espionage, which folds information-gathering into the same risk economy as everything else (it costs gold, the spy can be caught).

**Diplomacy writes a relation matrix, but there is no "diplomacy subsystem" of code.** The `$879F/$804C` helpers Pact/Bribe/Marry use are *generic province-target-select* primitives shared by War/View/Ninja too. What diplomacy genuinely shares is **state, not code**: a pairwise **relation matrix at `$6193`** (packed triangular, `max·54+min`). Pact sets a pair to 70, Marry to 90 — and War's *"They are your allies!"* block reads the same table. Diplomacy is a data structure several commands poke, not a dedicated machine.

**One UI substrate underneath all 21.** Every command is built from the same parts: `$804C` (province select), `$D5E9` (number input), `$CEC4` (confirm/yes-no), `$D326`/`$D134` (text / formatted text), `$B1A6` (generic option submenu), `$E80C` (commit & display result). The command drivers are thin orchestration over a fixed widget set — which is exactly why decoding one (Grow) made the other twenty cheap.

## What's open

The **command layer** is mapped. What remains at this layer:

- **The effect formulas.** Each command's effect handler (Grow's `$87F0` is the only one fully traced) holds the exact numbers — Tax's rate→loyalty curve, Marry's success probability, Send's caps. Each is a short per-command walk.
- **The shared subsystems** — `$B1A6` (the Trade/Grant/Other submenu), the generic `$879F/$804C` target-select primitives, the `$6193` relation matrix, and `$D5E9` (the input primitive + its cap logic) — naming these opens several commands at once.

The two big systems the commands feed are the player's-half counterpart: **combat** (War's back end, ch.14–17) and the **daimyo AI** (the engine that picks among these same verbs, ch.12). With both, the synthesis chapter draws the dominance-frontier counter-graph the project was built for.
