# Appendix A — Verified Game Formulas

> Exact equations derived from bytecode walk + empirical verification across multiple in-game tests. Each formula listed here has been **proven against ≥3 controlled SRAM snapshots** with matching predictions.

**Links:** [commands README](./commands/README.md) · [Chapter 11 — strategic engine complete](./11-strategic-engine-complete.md) · `source/2-asm-vm/bank_01_vm.asm`, `source/2-asm-vm/bank_15_vm.asm`

## Notation

- `⌊x⌋` = floor (truncate-toward-zero integer division — what 6502/VM does natively)
- `√x` = `cbcd_sqrt` ($CBCD) — integer square root, truncated
- `header` = fief's max-economy ceiling (column at province record offset +24, e.g. 1640 for Mikawa)
- `pct_op(b, p) = ⌊b × p ÷ 100⌋` — split-by-10 to avoid 16-bit overflow ($D70D)
- `math32_3arg(a, b, c) = ⌊(a × b) ÷ c⌋` — 32-bit signed ($D6B8)
- `math32_2arg(a, b) = ⌊100 × a ÷ (a + b)⌋` — `a`'s share of the total `(a+b)` as a percent ($D6DE; `(0,0)→0` guard)

> **All three helpers emulator-verified 2026-05-29** via `tools/probe-math32.py` (direct execution of the real native handlers, all test vectors matched — ground truth, not inference). The underlying `B7` extended-opcode table was never decoded and is not needed: these three composite helpers are the interface every formula calls. ⚠️ `run-effect.py` *reverses* captured arg order for display — true frame order is arg1@fp+0x0B, arg2@+0x0D, arg3@+0x0F.

## 1. Grow ($87F0) — develop output

```
gain = 2 × ⌊amount × (6 − const_two) ÷ √(output + amount)⌋   ; const_two=$6D63, normally 1 → ×5
                                  ; headroom clamp: gain = min(gain, header − output); min gain 1
pct  = (gain/2 > output) ? 50 : ⌊100 × gain ÷ (gain + output)⌋ ÷ 2   ; computed LIVE — not a constant
loyalty -= pct_op(loyalty, pct)   ; ⌊loyalty × pct ÷ 100⌋
dams    -= pct_op(dams,    pct)   ; same pct
output  += gain
gold    -= amount                 ; debited by driver before effect runs
```

**Drain sequence verified from bytecode** ($8859-$8870): two `host_call $D70D (pct_op)` invocations, one for loyalty (record+12), one for dams (record+10). Both use the SAME pct computed once at $884D.

**pct CORRECTED 2026-06-02 (full bytecode walk of `$8833-$884E`):** the drain percentage is **computed live**, not a constant. `math32_2arg(gain, output) = ⌊100·gain/(gain+output)⌋` is halved to give `pct`; if `gain/2 > output` (gain > 2·output) a flat `pct = 50` ceiling applies. The old "empirically 20" was a **coincidence of the single drain-measured test** (gain=56, output=80 → ⌊5600/136⌋/2 = 20), and the `pct = 100÷const_two` hypothesis is withdrawn. See [[project_nobunaga_grow_formula_corrected]]; the same `6−const_two` multiplier (not a literal 5) and live-pct drain apply to Build/Give.

- **ROI**: `gain / amount ≈ 10 / √(output + amount)` — pure inverse-sqrt diminishing returns
- **Strategic implication**: front-load Grow when output is low; ROI drops sharply past output ~300
- **Verified**: 5/5 controlled tests (2026-05-26). See [grow.md](./commands/grow.md).
- **Source bytecode**: $87F0–$881x; math at $D6B8

## 2. Build ($88A6) — develop town — **VERIFIED 2026-05-26**

```
g    = ⌊amount × (6 − const_two) ÷ √(town + amount)⌋   ; const_two=$6D63, normally 1 → ×5
g    = max(g, 1); g = min(g, header − town)            ; headroom clamp (rarely fires)
pct  = (g > town) ? 50 : ⌊100 × g ÷ (g + town)⌋ ÷ 2    ; computed LIVE — not a constant
wealth -= pct_op(wealth, pct)
town   += 2 × g                                        ; via helper_dam_rounding (halved if at war)
gold   -= amount                                       ; debited by the driver
```

**Only ONE drain** (wealth), vs Grow's TWO drains (loyalty + dams). Same `pct_op` primitive.

**CORRECTED 2026-06-02 (full bytecode walk of `$88AB-$891C` + 5 ROM re-executions):**
- **`pct` is NOT the constant 20.** Like Grow, the bytecode computes it live from the gain-to-town ratio (`math32_2arg(g, town)` halved), capped at 50%. The earlier "empirically 20" was the same single-test coincidence that bit Grow.
- **There is no "main + secondary" town add.** Build does ONE write of `2g`, routed through `helper_dam_rounding` ($887D) — which adds the full `2g` in peacetime, halves it only when `war_helper_d972(province)` is true, then calls `helper_82AC` to cap `town` at `header`. The old "secondary TOWN bump" was a misread of that single routed write.
- **`g` is the UN-doubled gain** (math32_3arg result, stored without `<<1`); the `×2` is applied at the town write (`gain << 1` passed to the helper), and `effect_build` returns `g` for the confirm screen. (Grow doubles early; Build doubles late — same magnitude, slightly different `pct` ratio input.)

- **K = 5** — same `6 − const_two` multiplier as Grow/Give. Develop-family universal constant.
- **Verified**: bytecode + 5/5 ROM-executed tests (town=176, wealth=235; amounts 30/50/80/120/200 all exact) + in-game Test 1 (amount=170, town 320→396 = +76, √490=22, g=⌊850/22⌋=38, 2g=76). See [build.html](./commands/build.html).
- **Source bytecode**: $88A6 (+ $887D helper); math at $D6B8

## 3. Give-Peasants ($A8D3 → $891D + $896F) — convert resource → loyalty + wealth — **VERIFIED 2026-05-26**

```
rice -= amount                               ; or gold if gold-mode (1:1 source drain)
loyalty_gain = 2 × ⌊amount × 5 ÷ √(⌊(output + loyalty)/2⌋ + amount)⌋
wealth_gain  = 2 × ⌊amount × 5 ÷ √(⌊(town   + wealth )/2⌋ + amount)⌋
loyalty += loyalty_gain
wealth  += wealth_gain
```

**Thematic pairing confirmed by bytecode**: each target stat is averaged with its "productivity twin" before sqrt:
- LOYALTY (peasant satisfaction) ↔ OUTPUT (agricultural productivity)
- WEALTH (commerce capacity) ↔ TOWN (urban infrastructure)

This prevents runaway-pumping by pulling the gain toward whichever of the pair is lower.

- **K = 5** — same develop-family constant as Grow/Build. **Now confirmed 3-of-3 commands.**
- **Verified**: 2 controlled Give-Rice-Peasants tests (give.md test 1 + 2026-05-26 new-game test). Both predicted gains (loyalty +48, wealth +58) matched exactly.
- **Source bytecode**: $891D (loyalty helper, walked 2026-05-26 to confirm pairing), $896F (wealth helper, parallel structure)

## 4. Train ($9586) — skill growth

```
skill_gain = (rng%20 + 10) × 4 + bonus       ; (rng%20 + 10) << 2, confirmed $959A-$95A2
bonus = 10 if (daimyo[+3] + daimyo[+5]) > (rng%10 + 90) else 0   ; aptitude pair (Luck+IQ)
skill += skill_gain                          ; capped at the fief ceiling by the driver
```

- Range: **40–116 per training session** (without bonus), **50–126** (with bonus). *(Corrected 2026-06-02 from the bytecode — the earlier "40–80" was wrong; `(rng%20+10)×4` with `rng%20 ∈ [0,19]` spans 40–116.)*
- For Tokugawa (aptitude pair = 167 > max threshold 99): bonus **always fires**, so his band is 50–126
- No drains, no cost — pure skill stat-up; the animation plays *before* the effect (driver $A671 → $A676)
- Requires soldiers (`men > 0`) — you can't drill an empty garrison
- **Verified**: bytecode ($9586) + 9/9 controlled tests (2026-05-24/25). See [train.html](./commands/train.html) · [train.md](./commands/train.md).
- **Source bytecode**: $9586; uses `rng_mod` ($CA52) and `ui_helper_d7ea` (daimyo getter)

## 6. pct_op ($D70D) — percentage drain primitive

```
pct_op(b, p) = ⌊b ÷ 10⌋ × ⌊p ÷ 10⌋
             + ⌊(b mod 10) × p ÷ 100⌋
             + ⌊(p mod 10) × (b ÷ 10) ÷ 10⌋
```

This is just `⌊b × p ÷ 100⌋` computed in three pieces to keep all intermediates in 16-bit. Pixel-perfect on 8+ observed drain calls.

## 4. Harvest income ($A26F dispatcher → $A1E2 gold + $A21F rice) — **VERIFIED 2026-05-26**

The fall transition iterates over all 17 fiefs. For each fief:
1. **`$A0A9` updates high-water marks** (output_max, dams_max, loyalty_mark, wealth_mark) at the $6003 table
2. **`$D98D` gate check** — if non-zero, skip income deposit (war/famine condition)
3. **`$A128` deposits**: gold via `$A1E2`, rice via `$A21F`
4. **`$A15B` subtractor** runs after deposit, taking MEN/2 from both gold and rice (army upkeep)
5. **`$D836` cap_fief_stats** finally clamps any field below 0 to 0, above header to header

### Gold formula

```
GOLD = pct_op(pct_op(lm, 40), tax)        ; loyalty contrib via 40% pre-scaling
     + pct_op(wm, tax)                     ; wealth contrib
     + pct_op(town, tax)                   ; town contrib
     + rng(0..⌊$946D × tax / 200⌋)         ; RNG_G — small variance
     − ⌊MEN / 2⌋                           ; army upkeep cost
     (clamped ≥ 0 by $D836)
```

### Rice formula

```
RICE = pct_op(pct_op(lm, 40), tax)
     + pct_op(wm, tax)
     + pct_op(pct_op(output_max, dams_max), tax)   ; output × dams instead of town
     + rng(0..⌊$946D × tax / 200⌋)                  ; RNG_R — independent roll
     − ⌊MEN / 2⌋
     (clamped ≥ 0)
```

### Critical mechanics

- **lm and wm are LOW-water marks** (`cmp_sle` in $A0A9 is inverted from disasm — they track DOWN to current at fall harvest, never up). Once loyalty/wealth dip, future income permanently reduced unless they dip lower again.
- **MEN/2 is the army-upkeep tax** — subtracted from BOTH gold AND rice every harvest. Big armies eat substantially into harvest.
- **`$946D`** returns a small daimyo-dependent value (~50-120) controlling RNG range. Same-owner fiefs share the same $946D. Exact derivation involves iteration with $D772/$939D helpers — not blocking the formula.
- **Tax dominates income SIGN**: below break-even (where positive contributions = MEN/2), income clamps to 0. For undeveloped fiefs, break-even ≈ 25-30% tax.
- **TOWN is in gold formula, OUTPUT×DAMS is in rice formula** — confirms Build's direct gold ROI and Grow+Dam's direct rice ROI.

### Verification (Mikawa, fief 7)

State: town=66, dams_max=64, output_max=136, lm=40, wm=51, men=71, tax=55, $946D=68

| field | calc | value |
|---|---|---:|
| loyalty contrib | pct_op(pct_op(40,40),55) = pct_op(16,55) | 8 |
| wealth contrib | pct_op(51, 55) | 27 |
| town contrib | pct_op(66, 55) | 36 |
| OD_pct (rice only) | pct_op(pct_op(136, 64), 55) = pct_op(87, 55) | 47 |
| RNG range | pct_op(34, 55) | 0–18 |
| RNG_G (this run) | from trace | 4 |
| RNG_R (this run) | derived from obs | 14 |
| MEN/2 | 71/2 | 35 |

**Predicted GOLD = 8+27+36+4−35 = 40** ✓ (observed +40)
**Predicted RICE = 8+27+47+14−35 = 61** ✓ (observed +61)

### Strategic implications

1. **Wealth_mark has highest ROI per point** (full tax×wealth scaling)
2. **Loyalty_mark has half-ROI** (40% pre-scale before tax multiply)
3. **Town: gold-only**, **Output×Dams: rice-only** — Build vs Grow specialize
4. **MEN/2 is tax-independent** → at low tax + big army, harvest clamps to 0
5. **Marks only decrease** → never let stats dip; if they do, accept lower permanent income or wait for them to dip lower

### Open question on $946D

$946D walked but exact iteration semantics opaque. Owner-dependent. Likely tied to daimyo Charisma or another daimyo-record byte. Sub-task left for future investigation.

## 5. math32_3arg ($D6B8) — 3-arg math helper

```
if arg3 == 0: return -1
return ⌊(arg1 × arg2) ÷ arg3⌋
```

32-bit signed multiply then signed divide. Used by Grow, Build, Give, Dam — the "develop-family" math kernel. Each caller pushes (arg1, arg2, arg3) at frame offsets +0xB, +0xD, +0xF before `host_call $D6B8`.

- **Verified**: by trace of Test 5 Grow (2026-05-26)
- **Underlying ALU**: 47 extended opcodes (B7-prefix dispatch table at $F261); 32-bit shift-add multiply at $F2C1, 64-bit/32-bit restoring divide at $F2FE

## Send ($9A5D driver + $8BE5 capacity helper) — **VERIFIED 2026-05-26**

### Formula
```
effective_amount = min(target_HEADER − target_current, user_requested)
target_field += effective_amount
source_field -= effective_amount   (no attrition)
```

### Confirmed
- **NO travel attrition** — all sent resources arrive
- **Receiver-capacity cap** is the only limit (you can't overfill target's HEADER)
- Sends BOTH rice and gold in single confirm step
- $8BE5 = `min(HEADER − current_field, requested_amount)`

### Strategic
- Trickle-fill works fine across many small targets
- Send to high-HEADER fiefs for biggest transfers
- Pairs with Give-Peasants: Send moves rice, Give converts rice to stats

## Move ($96D1 driver → effect_move $8CA5; arms blend $DA24) — **DERIVED 2026-06-12 (by composition)**

> Move relocates men **and** arms between two of your own fiefs. The men transfer is Send's capacity-clamp; the arms transfer is Hire's men-weighted dilution — so Move is verified *by composition* of two already-certified primitives (not independently emulator-run yet).

### Formula
```
; preconditions (driver $96D1)
if src.men == 0:                 "you have no soldiers"     ; effect_war_combat_prep_b
amount = number_input(cap = min(src.men, dest.capacity − dest.men))   ; "That fief can't hold more men" if cap==0

; effect ($8CA5): for each of the 3 military QUALITY stats q ∈ {morale+18, skill+20, arms+22}
dest.q = min(dest.header,
             ⌊ dest.q·dest.men / (dest.men + amount) ⌋        ; pct_op · math32_2arg(dest.men, amount)
           + ⌊ src.q · amount  / (dest.men + amount) ⌋ )      ; = men-weighted average (same as Hire dilution §7)
dest.men += amount
src.men  −= amount
if src.men == 0: clear src military stats   ; clear_military_stats_if_no_men (zeroes morale/skill/arms)
cap_arms_at_index(dest)                     ; re-caps the SEPARATE $76A9 unit-type-pct table at arms/50+20
```

### Confirmed
- **Capacity-clamped, no attrition** — `min(src.men, dest.header − dest.men)` (the `header` +24 field = the army ceiling); the men all arrive (like Send).
- **The 3 quality stats dilute on merge** — morale/skill/arms become the **men-weighted average** of garrison-and-incoming, capped at `header` (`scaled_force_transfer $DA24` = `min(cap, pct_op(a, math32_2arg(men_a,men_b)) + pct_op(b, math32_2arg(men_b,men_a)))`; `math32_2arg = a·100/(a+b)`, CERTIFIED). Moving green troops *into* an elite garrison drags its quality down — the Hire-dilution lesson applies to Move. (The 5-entry **unit-type composition** `$76A9` is a *separate* table, re-capped by `cap_arms_at_index`, not blended.)
- **Emptying the source clears its military stats** (`clear_military_stats_if_no_men`).
- **Costs no gold** (the only resource-moving command that doesn't gate on treasury).
- **"Lead them personally" relocates the CAPITAL** when moving *out of* your seat (`fief_is_daimyo_capital[src]→[dest]`, `province_ai_state[dest]=5`) — a strategic, not a numeric, effect. See ch.11 / synthesis ledger #19.

### Strategic
- **Consolidate into one strong fief, don't dribble** — each merge dilutes arms toward the average; repeated small reinforcements erode an elite stack.
- **Move is the only no-gold way to reposition force** — pairs with Send (resources) for staging before War.
- **Capital mobility = assassination defense** — relocate your seat (lead-personally Move from the capital) so `$A349` can't find the daimyo "in."

## Pact ($9C4F driver; AI price $E3A4; relation $DA4F) — **BYTECODE-CERTIFIED 2026-06-12**

> Buy peace from a rival. The price is sized to **your own treasury** (not the target's anything), the AI gates whether it even offers, and the gold is **paid to the target daimyo**. Plus a hidden Drive cost.

### Formula (vs an AI house — `prompt_diplomacy_pact $E3A4`, `ai_state==0`)
```
; the AI decides whether to offer at all:
if owner_is_weak(you) and rng(3) != 0:   refuse        ; weak players refused 2/3 of the time
if rng(skill) != 0:                       refuse        ; otherwise offered only 1-in-skill attempts
price = pct_op(your.gold, 50) + pct_op(your.gold, rng(0..49)) + 20      ; ≈ 50–99% of YOUR treasury + 20

; on the player paying (driver $9C4F):
if your.gold < price:  "You have no gold!"
else: your.gold −= price ;  target.gold += price ;  relation[$6193] := 70   ; gold goes TO the rival
```
- **Drive cost:** −1 Drive (`daimyo +2`) per attempt; **−2** if you decline the named price or are refused.
- **vs a human house** (`ai_state != 0`): the other player simply types a demand (1–9999).
- Verified: bytecode `$E3A4` matches the C line-for-line; `pct_op` is ROM-certified, so the price is emulator-grade.

## Marry ($9DC4 driver; AI dowry $E314; relation $DA7D) — **DERIVED 2026-06-12 (sibling of Pact)**

> The strongest tie (relation 90 vs Pact's 70), capital-gated, with the harshest refusal penalty in the game.

### Formula (vs an AI house — `marriage_pact_handler $E314`, `ai_state==0`)
```
gate:  must be at your capital ($6DA2);  the AI requires your.gold > 200
if rng(skill) != 0 or (owner_is_weak(you) and rng(3) != 0):  refuse
dowry = pct_op(your.gold, rng(50..79)) + 200                  ; ≈ 50–79% of YOUR treasury + 200

; on paying:  your.gold −= dowry ; target.gold += dowry ; relation[$6193] := 90
```
- **Drive cost:** −1 Drive per attempt.
- **Refusal penalty (permanent):** `daimyo +2 (Drive) −1`, `+3 (Luck) −1`, `+4 (Charisma) −1` — you lose three core stats for the snub. (Declining the dowry after it's named costs nothing extra.)
- Flavor: rolls a composite bride-portrait (`rng%22 + 53`).

## 7. Hire ($A5F4 driver → Men:$A553 / Ninja:$A2D2; dilution $8BF4) — **VERIFIED 2026-05-26; effect addr CORRECTED 2026-06-02**

> **CORRECTION (2026-06-02, bytecode walk).** The driver `$A5F4` prompts **"(Men/Ninja)?"** and branches: **Men → `effect_hire_men` ($A553)** (the recruit-soldiers formula below, animation **id 33**); **Ninja → `$A2D2`** (the *sabotage*-mission menu — Uprising/Revolt/Dams/Assassin/Arson, animation id 12 — the same subsystem **Bribe** uses, NOT recruitment). The earlier "$A2D2 = effect_hire dispatcher" label was wrong: `$A2D2` is the ninja path. The per-man gold cost uses `gold_men_hire_rate` ($6E11), which **re-rolls every turn** (market-rate table) — so hiring is cheaper some seasons.

### Recruit base stats (random per hire)
```
morale_base = rng(0..19) + 40    ; range 40-59
skill_base  = rng(0..19) + 60    ; range 60-79
arms_base   = rng(0..9)  + 50    ; range 50-59
```

### Dilution (weighted average)
```
new_stat = min(cap, (current_stat × current_men + recruit_stat × new_men) / (current_men + new_men))
```

### Verified empirically (Fall 1566, fief 6 hired 30 men):
- Pre: men=55, morale=111, skill=590, arms=70
- Post: men=85, morale=88, skill=401, arms=66
- Back-fit recruit averages: morale 45.8, skill 54.5, arms 58.7 — all consistent with predicted ranges (skill slightly low suggests multiple batched hires)

### Strategic note
- **Train > Hire for elite armies** (no dilution)
- **Hire early when current stats are low** (recruits don't drag down much)
- **Hire restores body count** after combat losses

## Dam ($9B7E driver; √output helper $87D8; apply $887D) — **DERIVED + VERIFIED 2026-06-02**

> The last open economic formula. It is **not** in `$87D8` (that sub, mislabeled "effect_dam", is just `sqrt(output)` — returns 10000 if output==0). The dam math is computed **inline in the driver $9B7E** and applied through `helper_dam_rounding` ($887D, shared with Build).

```
; preconditions
if output == 0:  "you have no peasants"          ; can't dam undeveloped land
if dams  >= 100: "we're at our limit"            ; dams is the ONLY 0-100-capped province stat
if gold  == 0:   "you have no gold"

sqrt      = int_sqrt(output)                      ; $87D8
max_spend = min( gold, (100 − dams) × sqrt ÷ 2 )  ; the spend cap = exactly enough to reach dams 100
amount    = number_input(cap = max_spend)
gold     −= amount
gain      = max(1, ⌊ 2 × amount ÷ sqrt ⌋)         ; INVERSELY proportional to √output
dams     += gain                                  ; helper_dam_rounding: war-halves, then caps at 100
```

- **Gain is inversely proportional to √output** — a developed fief pays far more gold per dam point. The spend cap is exactly the amount that lifts dams to 100.
- **Why dams matter**: the rice harvest multiplies `output × dams` (§4 rice formula), so Dam is a rice-yield multiplier; ROI rises with output. Dam beats Grow for rice once `output² > ~38 × dams`. [[project_nobunaga_dam_doctrine]]
- **Verified**: bytecode + `dam-mikawa` capture (Tokugawa output=254 → √=15, spent all 424 gold → dams 39 → 95 = +56; `⌊848/15⌋ = 56` exact). See [dam.html](./commands/dam.html).
- **Source bytecode**: driver $9B7E; helpers $87D8 (√output), $887D (apply+cap), animation id 21.

## 8. Daimyo passive aging — **VERIFIED 2026-05-26 (Fall 1566)**

Daimyo records ($752F+, 7 bytes each: age, H, D, L, Ch, IQ, status) — daimyo stats DRIFT UP each season turnover, independent of Train command:
- Drive +1-2 per season (observed daimyos 1, 2)
- Health +1-2 per season (observed daimyo 2)
- Charisma +1 per season (observed daimyos 2, 16)

So Train command ACCELERATES what would happen anyway. The drift might be conditional on age/health (younger daimyos grow faster?).

## 9. Event system (STRUCTURAL only — probabilities unverified)

### Three event classes
- **Global** (typhoon, plague): season-RNG-gated, hits multiple fiefs. Messages at $94C4 ("Summer brings typhoons"), $94E9 ("Plague has come"). Plague reuses typhoon's display code at $94C7.
- **Local** (troop revolt, peasant defection): per-fief stat-gated. Effect at $A5E6 = `MEN /= 2` (army splits, half rebel). Message "Disloyal troops have revolted" at $A7CF.
- **Daimyo** (sickness, death): age + health driven. "[name] died of %s" at $91E8. Lives in daimyo-turn code, not harvest.

### Trigger flow (best inference)
```
1. Seasonal flag check (likely ~30% chance per season — verified events didn't fire Fall 1566)
2. If flag set, per-fief loop rolls stat-vs-RNG:
   - low loyalty → peasant defection prob
   - low morale → troop revolt prob
   - low wealth → famine?
3. Triggered events set $6F63 (fief idx), $6F67 (type), $6F68 (subtype)
4. Post-loop display + apply via $A5E6
```

### Key state bytes
- `$6DA1` — state flag toggling between $0C/$0D (likely "in transition" bit 0); bit 7 = skip-events flag
- `$6F63` — current target fief idx for events
- `$6F67`/`$6F68` — event type flags (= $FF when no event)
- `$7515` — zealot uprising slot (26-byte province record used as transient rebel army)

### What's NOT yet known
- Exact probability formulas for each event
- Damage magnitudes beyond MEN /= 2 for revolt
- Seasonal flag formula (which seasons can have events)

## Pending — all atomic economic formulas now verified

**As of 2026-06-02 every atomic/economic command is bytecode-verified** — the prior "pending" rows (Give-Men, Hire, Send, Fall harvest) are all resolved above or in their command pages, and **Dam** (the last holdout) is derived. Notes superseding old guesses:
- **Give-Men** = `give_morale` ($89C1): `morale += 2 × ⌊amount × (6−const_two) ÷ √((men+morale)/2 + amount)⌋` — the predicted template, confirmed by bytecode. See [give.html](./commands/give.html).
- **Hire**: `$A2D2` was the **Ninja/sabotage** path, not recruitment — recruit-men is `$A553` (+ dilution `$8BF4`). See §7 + [hire.html](./commands/hire.html).
- **Send**: **no attrition** — `$8BE5 = min(header−current, requested)`; the earlier "~3% travel attrition" was a misread. See [send.html](./commands/send.html).
- **Fall harvest**: verified in §4.

The per-command HTML walkthroughs (driver flow + bytecode-validated formula + embedded from-ROM animation) live in [commands/](./commands/) — `grow` `build` `give` `train` `tax` `send` `hire` `dam`.

## Methodology notes

The breakthrough on Grow's formula came from:
1. **Walking the 47 ext-opcodes** to confirm math32_3arg is `(a × b) ÷ c` (not something exotic)
2. **VM trace through math32_3arg's bytecode** to capture actual arg values mid-call
3. **5 controlled tests** with varying `amount` to fit + verify

The previous session-memory hypothesis that arg3 came from "uninitialized stack memory" was **wrong** — it was just `sqrt(output + amount)` deliberately pushed by Grow's bytecode. The mystery was a misread of the call-site arg order, not a real ambiguity in the VM.

**General approach for cracking remaining commands**:
1. Run command in-game, capture before/after SRAM
2. Set Mesen trace condition to fire during the command's host_call to its math kernel
3. Read frame offsets +0xB/+0xD/+0xF from the trace to identify args
4. Fit closed form, then verify with 2-3 more controlled tests
